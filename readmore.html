                                Built by Shivaji, Sindhudurg Fort was the naval headquarters of the Marathas. Situated on Kurte Island, it lies half a km away from the Malvan Port in the Arabian Sea. The fort lies 130 km north of Goa. 
                                Shivaji built the fort area to safeguard the maritime borders of his kingdom and from neighbouring rulers. The foundations of the fort were strengthened by using molten lead mixed with mortar. More than 70,000 kilos of iron was used for casting its foundation.

                                    Shaniwarwada is an 18th-century fort in the city of Pune in Maharashtra, India. Built in 1746, it was the seat of the Peshwa rulers of the Maratha Empire until 1818 when the Peshwas lost control to the British East India Company, after the Third Anglo-Maratha War. The fort itself was largely destroyed in 1828 by an unexplained fire, but the surviving structures are now maintained as a tourist site.

                                            Located 15 km away from the main city of Aurangabad, Daulatabad Fort is an ancient fortification that rises formidably from the midst of verdant greenery. Often hailed as one of the 'seven wonders of Maharashtra', this architectural marvel is believed to have been built in the 12th century. Also known as Devgiri fort, perhaps the most enchanting qualities is its location, from the zenith of which you can capture a mesmerising view of the entire city. You need to hike some 750 odd steps up to the top, but the view down below is a wonderful thing to behold.

                                                    The Panhala Fort lies 20 km away from the main city of Kolhapur, situated at its north-west. This fort holds its position amongst the most massive location in the country and is the largest one in the Deccan region. It was built in a strategic position where a major trade route ran within Maharashtra from Bijapur to the coasts of Arabian Sea. This place is not only a must-visit for the people who love exploring historic locations but also for those who love to trek.
